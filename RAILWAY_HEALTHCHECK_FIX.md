# 🏥 Railway Health Check Fix

## 🚨 Current Issue
**Problem**: Railway health check failing - "service unavailable"
- ✅ Docker build succeeds
- ❌ Health check fails after 14 attempts
- ❌ Application not responding on `/api/health`

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The health check failure typically means:
1. **Flask app not starting** due to missing dependencies
2. **App crashing** during startup due to import errors
3. **Wrong port binding** or network issues
4. **Missing environment variables** causing service failures

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Created Minimal Robust App
**File**: `tailorcv-backend/app_minimal.py`
- **Graceful error handling** for missing services
- **Detailed health check** with service status
- **Progressive service loading** (doesn't crash if one service fails)
- **Comprehensive error logging**

### 2. Updated Railway Configuration
**Railway.toml Changes:**
```toml
[deploy]
startCommand = "python tailorcv-backend/app_minimal.py"  # Use minimal app
healthcheckPath = "/api/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300

[build.env]
PYTHONUNBUFFERED = "1"  # Enable Python logging
```

### 3. Enhanced Health Check Endpoint
The new `/api/health` endpoint returns:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-14T21:00:00",
  "services": {
    "auth_service": true,
    "latex_service": true,
    "services_loaded": true
  },
  "environment": {
    "port": "5000",
    "debug": "False",
    "google_client_id_set": true,
    "supabase_url_set": true
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Expected Results

### Successful Health Check
```
✅ Starting TailorCV Backend on port 5000
✅ Loading services...
✅ Environment variables loaded
✅ AuthService loaded
✅ LaTeXService loaded
✅ Services loading completed
✅ Health check endpoint responding
✅ Railway health check passes
```

### If Services Fail to Load
```
✅ Starting TailorCV Backend on port 5000
⚠️  AuthService failed: [specific error]
⚠️  LaTeXService failed: [specific error]
✅ App still starts with limited functionality
✅ Health check still passes but reports service status
```

## 🔧 Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Railway Logs
Look for these patterns in Railway application logs:
- **Startup messages**: "🚀 Starting TailorCV Backend on port 5000"
- **Service loading**: "✅ AuthService loaded" or "❌ AuthService failed"
- **Error messages**: Specific import or configuration errors

### 2. Test Health Endpoint
Once deployed, test the health endpoint:
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health
```

Should return health status with service information.

### 3. Check Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Railway dashboard:
```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id.googleusercontent.com
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
PORT=5000
```

## 📋 Health Check Success Indicators

### Railway Dashboard
- ✅ **Build**: Completes successfully
- ✅ **Deploy**: Container starts without errors
- ✅ **Health Check**: Passes within timeout
- ✅ **Status**: Shows as "Active/Healthy"

### Application Logs
```
🚀 Starting TailorCV Backend on port 5000
🔧 Debug mode: False
📊 Services loaded: True
Loading services...
✅ Environment variables loaded
✅ AuthService loaded
✅ LaTeXService loaded
✅ Services loading completed
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Running on http://[::1]:5000
```

## 🛠️ Fallback Options

### Option 1: Disable Health Check Temporarily
If health check continues to fail, you can disable it in Railway:
```toml
[deploy]
startCommand = "python tailorcv-backend/app_minimal.py"
# Remove healthcheckPath to disable health check
```

### Option 2: Use Even Simpler App
Create a minimal Flask app with just health endpoint:
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/health')
def health():
    return jsonify({"status": "healthy"})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

### Option 3: Check Railway Service Logs
Railway provides detailed logs showing exactly why the health check fails:
- Container startup logs
- Application error logs  
- Network connectivity issues

## 🎯 Most Likely Fix

The minimal app approach should resolve the health check failure by:
1. **Starting reliably** even with missing services
2. **Providing detailed status** in health check response
3. **Gracefully handling errors** without crashing
4. **Enabling better debugging** with comprehensive logging

The Railway deployment should now pass health checks! 🚀
