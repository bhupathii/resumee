# üöÄ Deployment Files Restored

## ‚úÖ Files Restored

I've restored all the essential deployment configuration files that were accidentally deleted:

### **Railway/Nixpacks Configuration**
- `railway.toml` - Railway deployment configuration
- `nixpacks.toml` - Nixpacks build configuration  
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `Dockerfile` - Docker container configuration
- `.railwayignore` - Files to ignore during deployment

### **Vercel Configuration**
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration for frontend
- `package.json` - Project metadata and scripts

## üîß How to Fix Your Deployment

### **For Railway (Backend)**

1. **Push the restored files**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Restore deployment configuration files"
   git push
   ```

2. **Railway should now detect the project properly** and build successfully

3. **Set environment variables in Railway dashboard**:
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id.googleusercontent.com
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
   PORT=5000
   ```

### **For Vercel (Frontend)**

1. **Frontend should auto-deploy** from the same repository

2. **Set environment variables in Vercel**:
   ```
   REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id.googleusercontent.com
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-railway-backend-url.railway.app
   ```

## üéØ What Each File Does

### `railway.toml`
- Tells Railway how to build and deploy the backend
- Sets the start command to run the Python Flask app
- Configures health checks

### `nixpacks.toml`
- Specifies build dependencies (Python, Node.js, PostgreSQL)
- Defines build and install commands
- Sets the application start command

### `requirements.txt`
- Lists all Python packages needed for the backend
- Includes Flask, Google Auth, Supabase, ReportLab, etc.

### `Dockerfile`
- Alternative deployment method using Docker
- Sets up Python environment and dependencies
- Configures the container to run the Flask app

### `vercel.json`
- Configures Vercel to build and deploy the React frontend
- Sets build commands and output directory
- Routes all requests to the frontend app

### `package.json`
- Root package.json for project metadata
- Defines scripts for building and running the app
- Specifies engine requirements

## üöÄ Expected Deployment Flow

1. **Push changes** ‚Üí Railway detects Python project
2. **Railway builds** ‚Üí Installs dependencies from requirements.txt
3. **Railway deploys** ‚Üí Starts backend with python app.py
4. **Vercel builds** ‚Üí Creates optimized React build
5. **Vercel deploys** ‚Üí Serves frontend files

## üîç If Deployment Still Fails

### Check Railway Logs
- Look for build errors in Railway dashboard
- Common issues: missing environment variables, dependency conflicts

### Check Vercel Logs  
- Look for build errors in Vercel dashboard
- Common issues: missing environment variables, build command failures

### Manual Deployment Test
Test locally first:
```bash
# Backend
cd tailorcv-backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

# Frontend
cd tailorcv-frontend  
npm install
npm start
```

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

After restoration:
- ‚úÖ Railway recognizes the project as Python/Flask app
- ‚úÖ Nixpacks generates a build plan successfully
- ‚úÖ Backend deploys and responds to health checks
- ‚úÖ Frontend builds and deploys on Vercel
- ‚úÖ Google OAuth works with proper environment variables

The deployment should now work correctly with the restored configuration files!
