# 🔧 Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Current Issues

### Vercel Issue: Using Old Commit
**Problem**: Vercel is building from commit `20c80b7` instead of latest `0a92b2c`

**Log Evidence**:
```
[21:20:11.978] Cloning github.com/bhupathii/resumee (Branch: main, Commit: 20c80b7)
[21:20:18.615] sh: line 1: cd: tailorcv-frontend: No such file or directory
```

**This shows Vercel is:**
- Using old commit that doesn't have the fixed build configuration
- Still trying to run the old failing command

## ✅ Solutions to Try

### 1. Force Vercel Redeploy
**In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to your project
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
4. Check "Use existing Build Cache" is **UNCHECKED**
5. Click "Redeploy"

### 2. Manual Trigger
**Push a small change to trigger new build:**
```bash
# Already done - bumped version to 1.0.1
git add .
git commit -m "Force Vercel redeploy with latest fixes"
git push
```

### 3. Vercel CLI Manual Deploy
**If dashboard redeploy doesn't work:**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy from local
vercel --prod
```

### 4. Check Vercel Git Integration
**In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to Settings → Git
2. Verify it's connected to the correct repository
3. Check if branch is set to `main`
4. Ensure auto-deploy is enabled

## 🔍 How to Verify Fix Worked

### Expected Build Process
**Vercel should:**
1. Clone latest commit (0a92b2c or newer)
2. Run `npm install` (root level)
3. Run `npm run build` which executes:
   ```bash
   cd tailorcv-frontend && npm install && npm run build
   ```
4. Output to `tailorcv-frontend/build`
5. Deploy successfully

### Build Log Success Indicators
Look for these in Vercel build logs:
```
✅ Cloning github.com/bhupathii/resumee (Branch: main, Commit: 0a92b2c)
✅ Installing dependencies...
✅ > tailorcv@1.0.1 build
✅ > cd tailorcv-frontend && npm install && npm run build
✅ Installing frontend dependencies...
✅ Creating an optimized production build...
✅ Build completed successfully
```

## 🚀 Railway Backend Status

### Expected Railway Deployment
**Railway should:**
1. Use latest commit with fixed `railway.toml`
2. Build Docker container successfully
3. Start with `python tailorcv-backend/app.py`
4. Health check pass at `/api/health`

### Railway Success Indicators
```
✅ Building Docker image
✅ Container started successfully
✅ Flask app running on port 5000
✅ Health check passed
```

## 📋 Full Deployment Checklist

### Vercel (Frontend)
- [ ] Using latest commit (0a92b2c or newer)
- [ ] Build command: `npm run build` works
- [ ] Output directory: `tailorcv-frontend/build` exists
- [ ] Environment variables set:
  ```
  REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
  REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-railway-url.railway.app
  ```

### Railway (Backend)
- [ ] Using latest commit with fixed start command
- [ ] Docker container builds successfully
- [ ] Python app starts without `cd` errors
- [ ] Health endpoint `/api/health` responds
- [ ] Environment variables set:
  ```
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
  JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
  SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
  SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
  ```

### Database (Supabase)
- [ ] Schema applied from `fix_database_schema.sql`
- [ ] Tables exist: users, user_sessions, user_preferences
- [ ] No "column does not exist" errors

## 🔧 Emergency Deployment Methods

### Option 1: Direct File Deploy
If git integration is broken, deploy specific files:

**For Vercel:**
1. Download latest code
2. Use Vercel CLI: `vercel --prod`

**For Railway:**
1. Use Railway CLI: `railway login && railway deploy`

### Option 2: Manual Configuration Override
**In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Build & Output:**
- Build Command: `cd tailorcv-frontend && npm install && npm run build`
- Output Directory: `tailorcv-frontend/build`
- Install Command: Leave empty

### Option 3: Separate Repositories
Split into two repositories if monorepo continues to cause issues:
- `resumee-frontend` → Deploy to Vercel
- `resumee-backend` → Deploy to Railway

## 🎯 Most Likely Solution

The Vercel cache issue should resolve with:
1. **Version bump** (already done)
2. **Manual redeploy** in Vercel dashboard
3. **Clear build cache** option selected

This will force Vercel to use the latest commit with working build configuration! 🚀
